            Mon 13 January 2014


 
        </div>
        
        <div><p>Lately I've been noticing a lot of people writing and talking about information 
consumption by using a food metaphor
(<a href="http://www.marco.org/2014/01/03/the-builders-high">example</a>). I was going to 
write a post about it until I found that someone already did a great job of
that over at ribbonfarm:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/05/26/information-overload-and-the-food-is-thought-metaphor/">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2008/05/26/information-overload-and-the-food-is-thought-metaphor/</a></p>
<p>The article centers on metaphor theory, particularly as introduced by Lakoff
and Johnson in their book 
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=r6nOYYtxzUoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Metaphors We Live By</a>.
If you haven't read it, you should read it. It will probably change the way you
think about thinking significantly. The gist of the book, though, is that 
basic conceptual metaphors pervade our understandings and descriptions
of the world. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time as money ("spending time", "saving time")</li>
<li>Arguments as war ("attacking a point")</li>
<li>Good and bad as up and down ("feeling up", "things are going downhill"). This
is an example of an <em>orientational metaphor</em></li>
<li>Love as a journey.</li>
</ul>
<p>This quote from the ribbonfarm article stood out to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conceptual metaphors are always partial, and highlight some features of a
domain while de-emphasizing others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote communicates a point that I think is pretty important,
especially in relation to the ongoing, raging debate about whether all this
"information overload" is good or bad for us (which I think has some merit, but
also tends to contain a little too much generational pessimism). If the stream
of information we are exposed to on the internet were actually food, obviously 
gorging on it the way many do would be quite unhealthy, and I think many people
have the concerns they have about excessive information exactly because of this
intuitive association of information as food. So, as the article also advises, I 
think it's important to be aware, when forming opinions about emerging
phenomena like the internet, of the conceptual metaphors or frames of reference 
we bring to those phenomena in order to understand them in a personal way, and 
how that affects what features of that phenomena we emphasize and de-emphasize.</p></div>
