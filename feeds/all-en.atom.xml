opportunity to do something I've wanted to do for a long time: 
create a smart home (technically, I'm more interested in home automation
projects, but that term isn't as sexy as &lt;em&gt;smart home&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my housemates and I have been talking a little bit about building a
budget roomba, a.k.a. a dust-buster on wheels, but that will probably take a
while and I want this house to be smart right away god-damnit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, writing this post is a way for me to brainstorm quick ideas for my new
home. My first thoughts go to the ever dependable
&lt;a href="http://inventables.com"&gt;inventables&lt;/a&gt; website, and all of the fun materials and
sensors they have available there. What comes to mind right away are &lt;a href="https://www.inventables.com/technologies/conductive-foam-sensor"&gt;conductive foam
sensors&lt;/a&gt;,
lovely things that let you close circuits by doing things such as
sitting down in a chair or stepping on a mat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other question is what do I want to automate? Well, I would love to create a
house that is responsive to my sleep schedule. So here's an idea, given
conductive foam and sleep as criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place the foam sensor under a mattress, and hook it up to a microprocessor 
  that controls a lamp dimmer or LED array and has a good clock. Easy slow-wake 
  alarm clock. A step up from conductive foam would be to embed an
  accelerometer in the bed.
  There is an iPhone app called &lt;a href="http://www.sleepcycle.com"&gt;Sleep Cycle&lt;/a&gt; that 
  uses the built-in accelerometer to estimate where you are in a REM cycle, and 
  hasten or delay an alarm accordingly. I would love to copy this idea but have
  the sensing trigger a lamp rather than an alarm, especially one that wouldn't
  require me to have my iPhone on the corner of my bed all night long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Non-utilitarian ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, these are easier to come up with and are more fun:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be really cool to have a glowing orb in the living room that
  coordinates it's color and brightness to house-wide internet bandwidth usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would be amused if each cupboard in the kitchen played a different song
  when you opened it. The spice cabinet could play spice girls, and the pasta
  cabinet could play Pavarotti.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is a good start.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have federally-issued documentation of my citizenship, my US
Passport. There ought to be a way to get my PGP key signed by the government,
so I can sign my messages as an American citizen, having the government be the
trusted authority on that matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is interesting because it doesn’t compromise my privacy. My private key is
still private, but the government, through a verification process similar to
the passport process, has declared they trust me to be an American citizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be added as a signal for NSA collection systems, since the NSA ought
to trust its own key-signing authority, it can be absolutely sure that an
encrypted communication it intercepts is from an American citizen, and thus
discard it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like this idea, with the emphasis on it being an opt-in service. 
Obviously one issue is that it would make it even easier to track
WHO we are communicating to. However, since the NSA already does this easily,
preventing them from doing so has to be accomplished by regulation and
oversight, not by technological safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="government"></category><category term="nsa"></category><category term="privacy"></category><category term="essay"></category></entry><entry><title>Lunch with the Financial Times</title><link href="http://benbp.net/2013/Aug/19/lunch-with-times.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-08-19T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ben Broderick Phillips</name></author><id>tag:benbp.net,2013-08-19:2013/Aug/19/lunch-with-times.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Despite it's occasional snoodiness, the article series Lunch with the Financial

Deller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flustered by all the comings and goings, I find myself asking Deller whether he
is interested in “relational aesthetics”, a term coined by French art critic
Nicolas Bourriaud to describe the kind of artwork that, like Deller’s, might be
said to create a kind of community. Deller, who started to shake his head at
“relational”, says that reading art theory makes him anxious but admits he
thinks good art shouldn’t try to do anything useful, and doesn’t like the way
art gets co-opted by politicians to solve social problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can tell that Manning, Assange and Snowden are all the same kind of
irritant, because, somehow, amazingly, the planet’s response is to physically
squish them. They’re all online big-time, and their digital shadow is huge, so
the response is just to squeeze their mortal human bodies, literally, legally,
extra-legally, by whatever means becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
